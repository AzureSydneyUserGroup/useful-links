- WSL now supports Defender, Intune and Entra ID and you can perform hardening of WSL for use in the enterprise. There is also a new distribution architecture to allow customisation of WSL distributions to suit enterprise or team needs.

- In the hybrid cloud space there has been some shifts in Azure Stack with the introduction of **Azure Local**. One item that caught my eye is the preview of VMWare migration support for Azure Local .

- Oracle still has a massive footprint, and the good news is that Microsoft's partnership offering with Oracle **Oracle Database@Azure** is now available for use in Azure's Australia East Region, with a disaster recovery (DR) paired region in Australia Southeast. Beyond this there were quite a few further announcements about additional capabilities being worked on such as Purview and Fabric integration, advanced networking and security support with Exascale coming soon.

- Close to my heart is the launch of multi-cluster upgrades for AKS that is delivered by Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager. This provides a coordinated way to control rolling out of Kubernetes and node image updates across multiple clusters.
